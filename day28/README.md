Example:
A: [2, 2, 0, 1]
Result: [0, 1, 2, 2]
Testing
Input Format
The first line contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case the input has two lines:

An integer 'n' denoting the size of the array A.
n space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.
Output Format
For each test case, the output has a line containing n space separated integers denoting the elements of the sorted array A.
